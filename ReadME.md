The purpose of this was to create functions that will create a random generated password. Many different variables and functions were used to structure the layout of the webpage. Array variables of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols were used to create a random password. 

In order to generate a password the user has to choose atleast one of the options that fulfill the criteria of the password generator. Then a random password will be generated that can be copied by the user and used.
